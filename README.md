To run the project, use `just dev`. You'll need to have `just` installed (install it here: https://just.systems/). Then open the web app in your browser.

You'll need to provide a `.env` file with a schema matching that specified in `./src/env.ts`.

See [notes](notes/Index.md) for all design and implementation details.
