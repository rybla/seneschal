description: Run code validation checks
---

After making your changes, run `just validate` to run a suite of code validation checks on the codebase. If there are any errors or other diagnostics, make sure to address them and run `just validate` again before submitting your changes.

When `just validate` runs successfully, it will prompt you to enter some information about your changes to enter into the changelogs.
