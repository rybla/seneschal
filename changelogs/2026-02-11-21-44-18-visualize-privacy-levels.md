# Visualize Privacy Levels

Updated the `SearchSection` component in `src/pages/index.tsx` to visualize privacy levels in the graph.

- Modified `nodeCanvasObject` to render public nodes in white and private nodes in purple.
- Modified `getLinkColor` to render public edges in white and private edges in purple (with appropriate opacity).
